Hey yiah yiah
 Yiah yea yea
 Hey yiah
An old man turned ninety-eight
 He won the lottery and died the next day
 It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
 It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
 Isn't it ironic
 Don't you think?
It's like rain on your weddin' day
 It's a free ride when you've already paid
 It's the good advice that you just didn't take
 And who would've thought, it figures
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
 He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
 He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
 And as the plane crashed down he thought
 Well, isn't this nice
 And isn't it ironic
 Don't you think?
It's like rain on your weddin' day
 It's a free ride when you've already paid
 It's the good advice that you just didn't take
 And who would've thought, it figures
Well life has a funny way of sneakin' up on you
 When you think everything's okay and everything's goin' right, right
 And life has a funny way nobody helpin' you out when
 You think everyhing's gone wrong and everything blows up
 In your face
A traffic jam when you're already late
 A no smoking sign on your cigarette break
 It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
 It's meetin' the man of my dreams
 And then meetin' his beautiful wife, umm
 And isn't it ironic
 Don't you think?
 A little too ironic
 And yeah, I really do think
It's like rain on your weddin' day
 It's a free ride when you've already paid
 It's the good advice that you just didn't take
 And who would've thought, it figures
And well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
 And life has a funny, funny way of helpin' you out
 Helpin' you out
