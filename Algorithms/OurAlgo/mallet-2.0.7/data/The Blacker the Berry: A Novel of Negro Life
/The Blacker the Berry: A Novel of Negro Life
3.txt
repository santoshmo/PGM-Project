              One of the most widely read and controversial works of the Harlem Renaissance, The Blacker the Berry...was the first novel to openly explore prejudice within the Black community. This pioneering novel found a way beyond the bondage of Blackness in American life to a new meaning in truth and beauty.  Emma Lou Brown's dark complexion is a source of sorrow and humiliation --

                                       Great book and just as relevant today as it was all those years ago.
The book hits the nail on the head on color coding and prejudice in our community, particularly on how self loathing plays itself out - how we turn on each other both light skinned and dark skinned, and how the need to white-up is presented in ways we may not be conscious of

Although practiced in our black community here in USA, other books suggest that this is not confined to our community here - see the other Book of the Month      ...more

                                       Wallace Thurman is such a striking writer--his style, particularly in this novel, is vivid, near-hypnotic, and this book is a mixture of racial/social critique, sordid melodrama, and a US travel narrative following protagonist Emma Lou's trials in early adulthood. The Blacker the Berry  analyzes American colorism, particularly within the African American community, especially inside intellectual circles and/or in Harlem of the early 20th century. Emma Lou is admittedly an infuriating character (      ...more

                                       Ehhhhh...It's one of those books that is important for its historical impact. And you know everyone wants to get behind it for its positive message, which, don't get me wrong, is a good message. Buuuuuut...

The good thing about the writing is that it makes for a quick, easy read. But the quality of the writing is pretty weak. It's like a corny "message" song that thinks simply having a message is excuse enough to not be very artful about delivering that message. The books tells more than it shows      ...more

                                       THE BLACKER THE BERRY. (1929). Wallace Thurman. ****.
 This novel was one of the ones included in the Library of Americas collection called Harlem Renaissance. It addresses the issue of prejudice among blacks themselves of truly black women. Although they admired lighter-skinned blacks, ones who were truly a deep black were shunned and ignored. The heroine of this novel is a woman named Emma Lou. She was raised in Boise by her family who had managed to become mildly successful and achieve a      ...more

                                       It's pretty tough to get through because the POV is the girl who hates her own skin, but it's an interesting look in shadeism. The intro in my copy (I read it when I was halfway through the book) was very misguided and no actual fact that were correct, sources, or any truths to the origins of shadeism were included. She also excuses colonialism from blame which is entirely incorrect. 

Thurman's writing style is mostly pleasing, but there are some parts in the book that begged me to abandon it and      ...more

                                       This is such a sad story. It was well written and touches on the sensetive subject of racial prejudice within the black community. The main character, Emma, is naive and insecure not solely do to societies views of dark skin, but mainly due to how she was raised and treated by members of her own family, who were of lighter complexion. Seeing an oppertunity to escape thier oppressive views she takes off to first L.A. and then New york. Instead of finding the color-blind mecca she expected she com      ...more

                                       This book is classic black America, written in 1929 -- well-written for its time and subject. Emma Lou was educated and had lived in Idaho. Her problem was her skin color, not just black but dark. It mattered then and I suspect it still matters today. The book is still timely because of the unexplainable prejudices people have against each other for preposterous reasons. Emma Lou tried to escape the pettiness of her small town at college and in big cities but her color mattered everywhere. This      ...more

                                       I'm only on page 50 of this novel and it's already struck a nerve with me. 

As a black gay man I can totally relate to the alienation Emma Lou experiences first hand from her own community. She because of her exceptionally dark skin (this internal racism still exist today within the black community) and myself because of my openness with my sexuality (a homosexual black man is considered the scourge of the black community).

For a novel written in 1929 it is amazingly relevant in today's society as      ...more

                                       This book is, by far, one of my favorite reads. It really digs deep into the social, moral, and mental issues plaguing the late 19th/early 20th century Negro-American. For me, it displays for the reader an uninhibited view of the duplicity of the Negro state of mind, how it affected the Negro family, and how it weakened the Negro community. It gives a deeper, more poignant interpretation of the color divide among one race of people and a foreboding insight into the issues faced by the 21st centu      ...more

This is the last book in the first volume of the 'Library of America's Harlem Renaissance Novels of the 1920's'. All of the stories contained have some sort of take on black-on-black racism, though none makes this issue its central theme as Thurman does in 'The Blacker The Berry'. Our protagonist, Emma Lou, comes from a family/social circle who is progressively trying to breed whiter and whiter offspringEmma Lou i      ...more

                                       Thurman's first novel, while a showing some typical signs of an immature prose writer getting the feel for a long genre, is still a pretty terrific novel that deals with the prejudice within the African-American community against people with dark skin pigmentation. Thurman skillfully shows the hypocrisy of this phenomenon in the experiences of his protagonist, a "black" woman who struggles for social and personal acceptance in a society that favors "high yellow" or "light brown" skinned people.      ...more

                                       Wallace Thurman is a genius. The ability of this man to not only observe but recreate the racial complexities in America into a story that is timeless (and quite relevant today thanks to the SCOTUS gutting the Voting Rights Act) is pure genius. I still think that "Infants of the Spring" is Thurman's best work that I have read so far, but that doesn't discount what he has done in "The Blacker the Berry" and its importance. 

The most striking impression this novel has left on me is the way that Emm      ...more

                                       Hadn't read Thurman's novel since high school and I must admit that novels from this literary era (the Harlem Renaissance) are often the worst kind of fiction for young wannabe writers. It certainly did not help my development as a writer. I had to read it again recently to prepare for a grad student's thesis defense on issues of "colorism" in the novel and although it was a quick read, I found little to get excited about in reading it again.

I'm going to echo what others have said: despite this book being written eighty-six years ago, it resonates today. It's a sad story, indeed. The only thing that annoyed me was the lack of character development on behalf of Emma Lou by the story's end. Some parts dragged on longer than they should have. Not a bad read at all.

                                       Written in 1929, The Blacker the Berry was a shocking novel in that it exposed, for the first time, the existence of racism with the black community. The main character, Emma Lou Brown, is a dark-skinned woman who struggles to find acceptance in a black community that prizes lighter colored skin tones. Leaving her home town in Idaho, Emma admits that she was the only black student in her high school. She hopes that her new collegiate life in Los Angeles will help her to find new friends, but ins      ...more

                                       Ugh. This book is so FRUSTRATING. Do not read it. Seriously. This book is supposed to illustrate the struggles with racism WITHIN the black community, and the story itself is good enough. But actually reading it... just about killed me. The main character Emma Lou is hypocritical, obnoxious, stuck-up, whiny, and unable to make any intelligent decisions for herself. What makes all this truly unbearable, though, is that that's the POINT. And this is supposed to be quality literature and everything      ...more

                                       The quality of the writing in this novel is so-so, but the topic is unique.

Sample quote: "The midnight show at the Lafayette on Friday is quite a social event among certain classes of Harlem folk, and, if one is a sweetback or a man about town, one must be seen standing in front of the theater, if not inside. It costs nothing to obstruct the entrance way, and it adds much to one's prestige. Why, no one knows."

                                       Bottom Line: The first novel to look at intraracial prejudice in Blacks.
First published in 1929, The book deals with an ugly & often unacknowledged fact of life: color prejudice. As a novel it's clunky, but as sociology it's devastating. It must have taken real courage to write this book.

                                       And yet another fascinating read from the Harlem Renaissance. This really was tragic and depressing; and it left me feeling very unsatisfied as there really isnt much of a conclusion . . . other than our heroines life will continue as it has. Knowing a little about Thurmans life, I do wonder how autobiographical this was.

                                       One of the best books I've read all year. So many strong messages and images illustrated by the author. The character evolved so much by the end of the book. I felt myself cheering over her renewed love for self as a black woman.
Truly great piece of literature.

                                       I originally gave this book a four-star rating. Thurman's writing style is mesmerizing, and his characters are as memorable as they are though-provoking in nature. Upon recollection, what made me change my rating was Thurman's bravery and honesty. Bravery in addressing a subject matter so taboo at the time, which led to sections of his own peers in Harlem's literary ranks to distance themselves away from him, and honesty in expressing the shameful beliefs shared between members of the African-Am      ...more

                                       It is a book that is very frustrating to read, because of the main character's [Emma Lou] outlook on everything in her life. It seems that she never takes any responsibility, or ownership of her own life, relying on the views/opinions of those around her. She knows that other blacks discriminate against her, because of her shade, yet, she does the exact thing to her people, just not on the basis of the tone of their "blackness". 

The Blacker the Berry will always be an important historical fixtur      ...more

                                       After reading Nella Larsen's Quicksand (1928) and Passing (1929), I wanted to read this and I am so glad that I did! Thurman's writing of "The Blacker the Berry" was not only courageous (racism within and a gay subtext - for the latter is undoubtedly found in the portrayal of Alva) his descriptive & sentimental novel is engaging and beautifully fluid.

                                       This was excellent read! For me it was an heartfelt and also tragic story in many ways for the main character Emma Lou! She does a lot of soul searching and tries to find herself. She has a lot of issues and the main one she deals with in the book is her skin complexion. If you love the book "Bluest Eye" by Toni Morrison you will also love this book!
