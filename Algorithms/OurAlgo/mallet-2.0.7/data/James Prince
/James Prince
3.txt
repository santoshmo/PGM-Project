Drake is family and the weak s from Puffy and Suge is on my radar, Prince said. First of all, Puffy feelin like he can put his hands on my family, open the doors for his family to be touched. You reap what you sow. And to Suge . . . you know I ride with Drake so I accept any invitation you want to bring. Im your worst nightmare . . . if any of you clowns cross me or my family, bad news. Gonna beat you home.
In December, TMZ unveiled a video of Combsperforming at a nightclub in Miami where he aired his grievances about Drake and the 0 to 100 beat, which was given to both Drake and Diddy by Boi-1da. After Drake released it on his own, Diddys feelings towards the rapper escalated, allegedly peaking with a fight between the two in Miami last December.
