While the tension between Drake and Diddy has seemed to cool down, at least publicly, Rap-a-Lot CEO James Prince is apparently ready for that action to spark back up. In audio obtained by TMZ, Prince takes aim at Diddy and warns him not to mess with Drake or it will "open the doors for his family to be touched." No word on if Prince plans to actually release this song in full at some point, but he also takes aim at Lil Wayne and Birdman, who he has had a long-running feud with in the past.
As for Drake, he just released his new short-film titled "Jungle," which you can view right here. Check out the audio of the song, which is actually more of just a rant with a beat, above.
