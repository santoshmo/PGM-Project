     Africa and China are at war. The battlefield: Europe. Enter: MAPPO's genetically engineered soldiers, The Elephantmen.         
     They were genetically engineered to be suprahuman weapons of mass destruction, but now they must walk amongst the people they were created to destroy.         
     A meteor falls in Santa Monica Bay, and the lives of Hip Flask, Ebony Hide, Obadiah Horn, Sahara and Serengheti converge with far reaching consequences for all.         
     As Hip Flask, Ebony Hide and Obadiah Horn go about their business in Los Angeles, 2259, a MAPPO sleeper cell has plans of their own for them.         
     A MAPPO sleeper cell reactivates Elephantmen, affecting not only the lives of Hip Flask and Ebony Hide but Vanity Case, Miki, Sahara and LAPD Lieutenant Blackthorne as well.         
     Someone is picking off Elephantmen, and Hip Flask vows to get to the bottom of it.         
     Sahara is pregnant, Panya is pregnant... and their lives are at risk. Meanwhile Hip Flask and Vanity Case enjoy a cup of tea and sympathy, and Miki meets Apostrophe. Then the Elephantmen Attack MARS!         
     Farrell and Hip Flask investigate a tragic lover's tiff... but perhaps there are bigger issues at stake.
