   It is a real shame this book is a "lost" classic.  The characters in this book are so real I feel I might see them walking down the street.
The only flaw I can spot in Thurman's book is an over  reliance on exposition.  I understand he probably wished to keep the story  moving and he had a lot of ground to cover, but this story just screamed  for more conversation between the characters.  Besides, Thurman, also a  playwright, is a master at conversation.
If you are reading this, then  you obviously have some sort of interest in the theme.  If that's true, you  owe it to yourself to read this book.  I read it over a 24-hour span.  I  bought it for my fiance, but when I opened the box and read the first few  pages, I was hooked.  I told my fiance that she would have to wait until I  finished it before she could get it.  Luckily, it was so engrossing, I  finished it the next day.

   I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community.  It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as the one family in the future.  I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.
I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life.  In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring.  These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out.  It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.
That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman.  There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's.  So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.
Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.
(1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book "Don't Play In the Sun" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. Read more

   The Blacker the Berry is a truly classic novel and one from a great time period - the Harlem Renaissance. Wallace Thurman weaves an unfamiliar tale of a African American woman who struggles with her skin color, the acceptance of family members and racism within the black community.
At the time "The Blacker the Berry" was written, it was the first novel of its kind to address issues widely known among the black community, but never discussed.
It's about a young woman, Emma Lou, who's darker skin tone brings anguish and breeds hatred not only for herself but from her lighter skinned relatives. Set in the 1920s, the main character travels from Boise, Idaho to Harlem, New York in hopes of escaping her problems back home. However, she only runs into deeper problems in a new city.
The "Blacker the Berry" shares with us her journey for self love and social equality. Every woman of any race or background can relate to this book in some manner. After reading the novel, I encouraged all of my friends to examine their own views on skin color and share them with others in hopes of breaking down barriers and unwanted stereotypes. It was a wonderful book and I enjoyed reading it because it was very descriptive about Harlem - my original home town.

   I've read this book several times and as an African-American who has dealt with this issue as a teenager, let me say that Black readers must beware! If you are among those looking for escapism, "positive images," and bourgeois fantasies, then read Ebony magazine- this is NOT the book for you. If you are looking for RAW reality that may cause you some discomfort but will AT LEAST make you think about your subconscious beliefs and bring about some serious self-examination, then GO for it! This and Carter G. Woodson's "Miseducation of the Negro" should be in every black person's home!

   Thruman's The Blacker The Berry was an outstanding piece of work. His vocabulary was exquisite. Emma Lou evoked sorry, shame, and anger in me all at once because I refused to accept her as the "underdog" and her  constantly looking for the "right sort of people" to make her  feel whole and accepted. I did feel empathy for her because she longed to  be truly loved but did not recognize that the ultimate love comes from  within and the sooner she accepted herself as a worthy human being she  would forever be dissappointed in her relations with others. The book had a  lot of passion and for a brief moment I thought Emma Lou was going  to  suffer a major depressive episode or commit suicide because she seemed so  hopeless. The ending was unexpected and it left me wanting Emma Lou to say  more.
