    How bout getting off all these antibiotics
 How bout stopping eating when I'm full up
 How bout them transparent dangling carrots
 How bout that ever elusive "could of"
 Thank you India
 Thank you terror
 Thank you frailty
 Thank you consequence
 Thank you thank you silence
 How bout me not blaming you for everything
 How bout me enjoying the moment for once
 How bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
 How bout grieving it all one at a time
 Thank you India
 Thank you terror
 Thank you frailty
 Thank you consequence
 Thank you thank you silence
 The moment I let go of it was the moment
 I got more than I could handle
 The moment I jumped off of it
 Was the moment I touched down
 How bout no longer being masochistic
 How bout remembering your divinity
 How bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
 How bout not equating death with stopping
 Thank you India
 Thank you Providence, thank you disillusionment
 Thank you clarity
 Thank you thank you silence...
