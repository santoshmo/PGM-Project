how do we deallocate disk blocks held by the current process? 
Or just update our list of which disk blocks are being used?
	- do we do nothing? so long as our bookkeeping knows we aren't doing anything with those disk blocks anymore

do we want to track which disk blocks are in use? I think yes. 
But how? an array of bools?

vm page vs vm address? like we want virtual pages but we also have 
offsets...how is this going to work?

currently have it so that delete_VM_Page only sets the base byte 
of the physical page to nullptr...is that ok? --> sounds like the 
idea of avoiding work

**STILL NEED TO CLEAR OUT DISK**

how do we keep track of which disk blocks to read from??

are the ppages in the page table the pages on disk or in RAM?????

I think we need some way to map a share id to its physical page or 
relevant virtual pages

need to assign a disk block as soon as we pull a physical page or 
write a physical page or whatever

get page from disk still has to deal with read/write faults and stuff

check read/write protections in syslog

instead of using upper_bound_of_arena, can also just use number of virtual pages to calculate upper bound


When assigning a disk block to a page:
1) check if block_allocation vector's size is less than total disk blocks. if yes, then push_back
2) check if blocks_in_use is less than total disk blocks. If yes, then iterate through vector until you find a 0.
use that disk block
3) error
