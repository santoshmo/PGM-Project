pager maps physmem into address spaces for one or more user programs

client programs can run in parallel, but pager is single threaded - will only handle one request at a time

one entry in page table for each virtual page
if read enable is set to 0, that is saying "notify the OS when the page is being read"
	--> so we want to set these to 0 so we can know whenever these pages are being referenced!
	
	--> read fault makes page read only
	--> write fault makes page read/write
	
Physical memory - 
Logical memory - disk blocks
Virtual memory - each virtual page is a page mapped into one or more processes

when I read from a logically zeroed page, I will read a 0

a logically zeroed page - don't need to actually zero it all unless it is going to be read

most object-oriented of the projects in this class
